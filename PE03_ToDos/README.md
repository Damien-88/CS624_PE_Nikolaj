This React Native app is a simple Todo List manager. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The app also features filtering options to view all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks. The core logic manages the list of tasks and the current filter. Users input new tasks, which are then stored with a title and completion status. The app displays these tasks based on the selected filter. Each task can be individually toggled for completion or removed. The app is built using a straightforward data flow to efficiently manage and display your to-do items.
